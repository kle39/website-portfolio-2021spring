      <h2>Vibrance</h2>
      <p><img class='usability-floating' src='images/penguin.jpeg' width='500' height='400' alt='Penguin Pal'/>
          In 2018, a group of students in
          Dr. Samosky's Art of Making class at Pitt completed their capstone project.
          The team created a wearable device for deaf and hard of hearing children
          that vibrates once music plays and allows the children to feel the
          music and dance. The original device was a monkey, and children at
          the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf wore the monkeys and danced
          with instructors from Attack Theatre.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester, I encoutnered a flyer
          describing Vibrance and asking for students to join the team, as a few
          of the original members were looking to revamp Vibrance. I immediately
          joined the team and currently remain a member. I fulfill two different roles,
          each with one other team member, throughout the process: Branding/Media
          and User Experience (UX).</p>
        <p>My role as part of the Branding/Media Team consists of various pieces: developing
           the website, creating and maintaing the Facebook account, creating the logo.
           My role as part of the UX team consists of various pieces: performing user
           testing, and creating the manual.</p>

      <h2>Digital Literacy</h2>
        <p>In the fall semester of 2020, I virtually volunteered, along with a few other
        Pitt students to put together four lessons on different topics of technology
        in which we delivered to the senior members of Macedonia FACE over the course
        of three months. Additionally, I was provided with a wonderful opportunity to
        speak at a Pitt Forum on behalf of my student experience.</p>
        <p>This semester, I am repeating this amazing opportunity with a new student team and
          additional, new lessons for senior members of Macedonia FACE. Four lessons are
          delivered between March and April.</p>
        <p>Here are samples from a few lessons:</p>
