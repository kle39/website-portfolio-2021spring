    <p>Welcome to my website portfolio! My name is Kenzie Eggert and I am
       a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, pursuing a Bachelor's degree
       in Information Science. I have my Associate Degree from
       Community College of Allegheny County in Computer Information Systems.
       My current studies are centered around User Experience (UX) and
       User Interface (UI) which I am extremely passionate about.
       I am looking forward to continuing my studies in this field!
       As you move through my site, you will find various pages with projects
       I have completed relating to my field of study, along with volunteer
       opportunities and my resume. Thank you for visiting!</p>
