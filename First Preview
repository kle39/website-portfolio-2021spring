In this preview, I am showing the content and html I comprised for each of the pages that I am including in my website portfolio. There are a few general next steps that 
pertain to all of the pages in which I need to pursue for this project in the future. First, I need to create a navigation menu. Additionally, I need to position the footer 
section appropriately. I also need to flesh out each of the details I include through writing. Lastly, I need begin building the “About Me” and “Resume” pages. After these 
steps are completed, I will build my css for each.

Viewing the index page demonstrates the hierarchy of headings to establish my portfolio and welcome users to the site. Following the headings includes a paragraph to 
introduce myself and provide visitors with a brief background of myself and introduce the other pages. Below this paragraph, I included a photo of myself. Following this, 
I included links to take users to the other pages. At the bottom of the index page, viewers will find the LinkedIn logo, which is a clickable button that will open my 
LinkedIn profile for users in a new tab.

The UX/UI page lays out the various links to completed UX/UI projects. Each heading indicates the specific area of the project with a link that will direct users to a 
new window for viewing. In the next steps, I need to include the rest of the links, along with descriptions for each project above each link. The footer includes the 
LinkedIn button to my profile as well. 

The volunteering page includes headings for each volunteer opportunity I have completed/am currently completing. The LinkedIn button is also available in the footer section.
In the next steps for this page, I need to provide descriptions of the type of volunteering and the experience/what I completed, as well as the necessary links for each 
volunteering opportunity. 

Overall, I am enjoying building my website portfolio, and I am looking forward to the next steps and learning more!
