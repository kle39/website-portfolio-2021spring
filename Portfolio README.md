Welcome to my website portfolio! 

As you navigate through my portfolio, you will find various projects I have completed thus far for the spring 2021 semester. I am majoring in Information Science and 
up until a few months prior to beginning the spring 2021 semester, I was unsure of a specific field of study within Information Science I wanted to pursue. After reflecting
in the fall on past courses, I knew I enjoyed web design, but wanted to focus additionally on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). After completing research on these two 
areas of study, I discovered UX/UI and immediately knew it was something I wanted to pursue. It was a strong break-through in my college career and continues to be. I want 
to emphasize my work and passions in this field thus far, along with my passion for volunteering, which I complete through the University of Pittsburgh. I also developed my HTML and CSS skills while building this portfolio, specifically through the use of navigation and floats. I hope you enjoy
learning more about me and my passions.

Thank you!
